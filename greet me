problem:

Write a method that takes one argument as name and then greets that name, capitalized and ends with an exclamation point.

Example:

"riley" --> "Hello Riley!"
"JACK"  --> "Hello Jack!"

solution:

var greet = function(name) {
/* PREP
parameters:
'name' will be an any-cased first name
returns: function will return "hello" and 'name' with uppercased first letter, ending with '!'
examples: ADRIAN or aDrIaN will return -> 'Hello Adrian!'
pseudo-code: 
  1) name needs to be all lowercased first
  2) then name needs to have first letter uppercased
  3) then name should get returned in a template literal, in between 'Hello' and '!'
*/
  let lowercased = name.toLowerCase()
  let upperFirst = lowercased[0].toUpperCase()
  return `Hello ${upperFirst}${lowercased.slice(1)}!`
};
