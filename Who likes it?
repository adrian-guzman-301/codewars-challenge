problem:

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
Note: For 4 or more names, the number in "and 2 others" simply increases.

Who likes it?
JavaScript:
function likes(names) {
  /*PREP
  parameters: an array of name strings that can be empty or have an unlimited number of name strings
  returns:
    1. if array empty, return 'no one likes this'
    2. if array has 1-3 strings, return strings appended by 'like this'
    3. if 4 or more strings, return first two names followed by the number of 'names' that 'like this'
    4. examples: 
        []                                -->  "no one likes this"
        ["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
        ["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
        ["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
        ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
    5. pseudo-code:
      1. check to see how many items are in array
      2. set up conditional
      3. if empty, return 'no one likes this'
      4. if 1-3 strings, return strings appended by 'like this'
      5. if number of strings >= 4, return first 2 strings appended by the number of other name strings in array

    if(names.length == 0) {
        return 'no one likes this'
    } else if(names.length == 1) {
        return `${names[0]} likes this`
    }  else if(names.length == 2) {
        return `${names[0]} and ${names[1]} like this`
    } else if(names.length == 3) {
        return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names[2]} like this`
    } else if(names.length > 3) {
        return `${names[0]}, ${names[1]} and ${names.length - 2} others like this`
    }
}
