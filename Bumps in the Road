problem:

Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.

Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (_) or bumps (n). If you are able to reach home safely by encountering 15 bumps or less, return Woohoo!, otherwise return Car Dead

solution:

function bump(x) {
    /*parameters: a string consisting of either '_' (flat road segments) or 'n' (bumps in the road) characters
    returns: if string contains 15 bumps or less, return 'woohoo!'
             else return 'car dead'
    examples: 'n________nnnnnn' --> 'woohoo!!'
              'nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn' --> 'car dead'
    pseudo-code:
      1. assign variables to '_' and 'n'
      2. create conditional
      3. if flat road segments >= 15, return 'woohoo'
      4. else return 'car dead'
    */
    let flatCounter = 0
    let bumpCounter = 0
    for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (x[i] === '_') {
            flatCounter++
        } else {
            bumpCounter++
        }
    }
    return bumpCounter < 16 ? 'Woohoo!' : 'Car Dead'
}
