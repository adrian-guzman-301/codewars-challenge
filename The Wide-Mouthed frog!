problem:

The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.

He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But, then he meets the alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!

When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.

Your goal in this kata is to create complete the mouth_size method this method takes one argument animal which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog. If this one is an alligator (case-insensitive) return small otherwise return wide.

solution:

// PREP

// Parameters: a conditional needs to be written, seeing if mouthSize function's 'animal' parameter is taking in 'aligator' as an argument
 
// Returns: if 'animal' is equal to 'alligator', return 'small'; otherwise return 'wide'

// Examples: first, 'animal' parameter will get checked if 'alligator' was passed through it
// if alligator is passed through, 'wide' returns
// else return 'small'

// pseudo-code
// attach a lowerCase method to animal
// write an if statement, checking what animal parameter is
// if animal is equal to in value and type to 'alligator,' return 'wide'
// else return 'small'

function mouthSize(animal) {
  animal = animal.toLowerCase()
  if(animal == 'alligator') {
    return 'small'
  } else {
    return 'wide'
  }
}
