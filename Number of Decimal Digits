problem:

Determine the total number of digits in the integer (n>=0) given as input to the function. For example, 9 is a single digit, 66 has 2 digits and 128685 has 6 digits. Be careful to avoid overflows/underflows.

All inputs will be valid.

solution:

function digits(n) {
/* PREP

parameters:
n will always be a number greater than zero

returns:
the number of digits contained in 'n' should be returned

examples:
if n = 9, 1 should be returned
if n = 999, 3 should be returned

psuedo-code:
1. convert n to string via toString method
2. split n string into individual elements
3. get the number of elements via length method
*/
  return n.toString().split('').length
}
